**Home-brew machine learning library for rust**
(alpha with a poorly optimized version of SGD has been implemented, working on improving optimizers now)

The goal of this library is to make machine learning projects fully accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of ML theory and rustlang.

*Inspired by the python implementation of Tensorflow*

To create a model, simply select your model architecture and cost function.  When you instantiate a model, you must define an input dim, which is an integer representing the size of an input vector.
